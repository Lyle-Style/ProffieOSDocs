Hi, I'm Profezzorn.
My real name is Fredrik HÃ¼binette, and I'm originally from Sweden, but nowadays I live in Washingon State, USA.

I wrote ProffieOS, I designed the Proffieboards, and I also do a lot of [other stuff](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/).

If you wish to contact me. Please go to [The Crucible](https://crucible.hubbe.net)

If you need help with something, go to the right category and start a new thread about your problem.
If you don't know which category to use, try the padawan area. You can also send me a personal message
on the crucible if it's a business or personal question.

Alternatively, you can go go to [The Rebel Armory](https://therebelarmory.com/board/97/profezzorns-lab)
Either create a thread in the section called "Profezzorn's Lab", or send a personal message to "Profezzorn".

Using email is not advisable as emails from unknown people usually end up in my spam folder.
Using Facebook messenger does not work, because I don't use that.
