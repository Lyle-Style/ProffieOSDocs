These commands are usually used for deeper diagnostics beyond typical use.  
For more typical use case commands, see [Serial Monitor Commands](serial-monitor-commands.md).  
# WARNING - While most of these are harmless, some of these are powerful and should only be used if you're familiar with how they work. 


##  scanid

## id

Show the blade ID. 

## dacbuf

Print the current contents of the dac buffer.

## list_named_style

List all available named styles.

## describe_named_style <style>

*NOTE* - The following commands only work if  
`#define DISABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_COMMANDS` in _NOT_ active in the config.h file. 

## monitor <topic>

Toggle extra debug printouts. Topic is one of: swings, gyro, samples, touch, battery, pwm, clash, temp, strokes, serial, fusion, variation

## volumes

Prints volumes of sounds currently occupying wav players.

## buffered

Prints buffering of sounds currently occupying wav players.

## get_ble_config

Show BLE PIN

## top

Prints statistics about how often things are running and how much cpu they are using. If something is slow, start by running this command a few times and see if something sticks out at you.

*NOTE* - The following commands only work if  
`#define ENABLE_DEVELOPER_COMMANDS` _IS_ active in the config.h file. 

## say _ARG_

    - bfd "Error in font directory"  
    - bof "Font directory not found"
